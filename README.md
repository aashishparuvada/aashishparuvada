### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> 

I’m [**Aashish**](https://aashishparuvada.me), a data scientist and I like building products that actually solve real problems.(Even though they are small)

Most of my work lives around:
- 🧠 Machine Learning, GenAI & LLM-based systems  
- 🐍 Python, data pipelines, and backend logic  
- ☁️ Cloud (mostly AWS) and production-ready systems  
- 📦 Product thinking - not just models, but *why* they exist  

I’ve worked across **data science, product, and customer-facing roles**, which helps me think end-to-end from problem discovery to shipping solutions.

Currently exploring:
- Scalable products 
- System design for ML-heavy products  
- Writing more about ML & product
